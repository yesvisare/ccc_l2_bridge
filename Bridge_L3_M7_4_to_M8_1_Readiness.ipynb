    "\n",
    "### M7.1 — Distributed Tracing\n",
    "- Track individual queries through entire RAG pipeline\n",
    "- Identify latency bottlenecks per component\n",
    "\n",
    "### M7.2 — Application Performance Monitoring (APM)\n",
    "- Code profiling and optimization\n",
    "- Documented P95 latency improvement: 850ms → 450ms\n",
    "- Memory leak detection before production\n",
    "\n",
    "### M7.3 — Custom Business Metrics\n",
    "- Bridge gap from \"system works\" to \"system delivers value\"\n",
    "- Monthly Recurring Revenue tracking\n",
    "- Feature adoption rates, query success metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### M7.4 — Intelligent Alerting\n",
    "- Alert reduction: 50 noisy alerts/day → 2 meaningful alerts/day\n",
    "- Anomaly detection catches problems before users notice\n",
    "- Auto-remediation for common issues\n",
