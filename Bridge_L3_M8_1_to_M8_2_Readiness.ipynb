    "M8.1 taught you to evaluate RAG quality using RAGAS metrics and automated pipelines. M8.2 teaches safe experimentation through A/B testing. This bridge validates that your evaluation infrastructure is production-ready before you start splitting traffic and measuring multi-dimensional trade-offs (quality vs. cost vs. latency). Without this foundation, you risk deploying changes that improve one metric while degrading others."
