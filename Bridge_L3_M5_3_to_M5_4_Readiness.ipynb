This bridge validates that your quality pipeline is operational and your vector infrastructure has the scale and metadata schema needed for backup/restore, blue-green deployments, and health monitoring.\n",

    "- **Nightly backups** with verification checksums\n",
    "- **Recovery in minutes** rather than hours\n",
    "- Enables confident experimentation and rollback\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Blue-Green Deployments\n",
    "- **Zero-downtime** index migrations\n",
    "- **Instant version switching** between old and new indices\n",
    "- **Rollback capability** if issues are detected\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Index Health Monitoring\n",
    "- **Automated alerts** for query latency spikes\n",
    "- **Index size tracking** to prevent capacity issues\n",
    "- **Corruption detection** before it impacts production\n",
