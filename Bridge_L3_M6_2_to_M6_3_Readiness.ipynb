Without secure secret handling, RBAC credentials and policies become new attack surfaces. You'll verify that Vault integration works, rotation is tested, commit hooks prevent leaks, and historical secrets have been identified and rotated."

    "- Configured environment-specific secret paths (dev/staging/prod with complete isolation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Zero-Downtime Secret Rotation\n",
    "- Teams validated rotating API credentials while systems served live requests\n",
    "- Maintained 5-minute grace periods where both old and new keys remained valid\n",
    "- **Result:** Zero failed requests during rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Secret Leak Prevention\n",
    "- Pre-commit hooks using detect-secrets scan every commit before it reaches GitHub\n",
    "- Automatically blocks commits containing credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Complete Audit Trail\n",
